  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans - all are created at assignment and won't change with update to original variable

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100 - value of age2 defined at initiation

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // returns same array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; 
    console.log(players, team); // both will include new assignment of 'Lux'

    // When updating reference array, changes will chain back to original array as well
    // Because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way with slice
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread - takes every item out of iterable, and places in new variable
    const team4 = [...players];


    //or use Array.from();
    const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy: it changes the original referenced object
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead? Object.assign();

    // first argument is blank object, second is object to pass, third is any changed/additional properties

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes, {});

    // if any changes made to dev on twitter/facebook level they will be reflected at original object
